# nitrogen_oxides_prediction
This repository consists of codes for both prediction and optimization. Prediction part tries to build a model that accurately predicts the level of nitrogen oxides in the output smoke applying support vector regression model, gradient boosting decision tree and long-short term model. While the optimization part uses reinforcement learning method such as deep Q Learning and actor to critic to optimize the ammonia input.
